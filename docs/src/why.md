## Why thumper?

I wanted a checksum-based sync tool that was convenient for both CI/CD and local use. It was important to me to have a fast installation to support CI usage. I wanted a fully self-contained binary that I could just plonk into a `~/bin` folder on any of my machines.

Thumper is the name of a very famous bunny.
